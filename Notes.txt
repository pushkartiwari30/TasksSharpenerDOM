In this task we will add the backend feature instae dof using the CrudCrud. 
Here the frontend will be run else whete and the backend wil be run elsewhere. 
We will run the front end by the method that we sued in DOM Manupulation . That is copy pasting the path of the html file into the browser. 
Meanwhile the backend will run on separate port. 
Now hwo to split the code is given in the video of task 18 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgVBj-IAgkg   Watch from 41 mins 
In the prev projects of the backedn we did Sever side rendering . But from now on we wil do client side renderig. This is fast. For client side rendering we export the dat ain son format instead of HTML, CSS file data. 
Technically we can say we will call thw backend from the fronetend and backend wil send the JSON response. 
We will call the backend from freontend by using Axios
